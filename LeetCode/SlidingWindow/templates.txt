there are 4 types of sliding windown problems

1) constant window size
2) longest subarray/ substring where <condition>
3) number of subarrays where <condition>
(usually where sum=x)
(to identify it has, no fixed way to shirnk the left... so we break the problem where we find number of subarrays where sum<=x and sum<=x-1 and subtract the two)
4) shortest/minimum window
